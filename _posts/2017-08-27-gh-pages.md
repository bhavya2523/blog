Hello there,

Today I had to remember what I did during my summer vacation as I have to send my (late) vacation status update. Hmmm, What I did ? ü§îüòë

Haa, I enjoyed this summer also as usual with little bit of working. I visited my native village which I do every year. Also I learnt JavaScript in addition to HTML and CSS.

I created a Wordpress blog (Yes! you are now reading it üòÅ) and also I tried to create my own portfolio page which I completed later. For that I chose Github pages and in this blog post I want tell about it (in brief).

## GitHub & GitHub Pages

*GitHub Pages* is a free place to store the files that run a website and host that website for people to visit (it only works for particular types of website, like basic HTML sites or Jekyll sites, and does not host databases).

*GitHub* is a visual way to use *git*, a system for *versioning*: keeping track of changes to computer files (including code and text documents) over time (as explained above). If you‚Äôre curious, here‚Äôs a friendly lesson for exploring GitHub.

Okay, here is the link to my portfolio page [vchrombie.github.io](https://vchrombie.github.io/).







## Why Github?

Because it‚Äôs easy and free. And if you don‚Äôt like Github, you can take the exact code you‚Äôve produced and put it anywhere else that acts as a web server. The important thing is: if you *do* want to learn web development, how to use Git, how to use Github, how to program, and so forth, this lesson provides a stepping-stone to those concepts as well as a canvas to practice on. And even if you don‚Äôt want to learn anything, you can come away with something useful: a customized web homepage that you can maintain yourself.

### Steps

1. First of all, you need to have a GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/ and setup your account.

2. Create a new repository with the name as `username.github,io` and and enter the details and click on the green `Create repository` button

    </p>

3. Go to the **Settings** on the repository home page and scroll down to the *GitHub Pages* section and enable the option for GiHub pages, choose the master branch for the source.

    </p>

4. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io/
    ```

5. Enter the project folder and add an `index.html` file. (Note: the filename should be `index.html` as the server recognises   that page to be displayed as the main page)

    ```bash
    cd username.github.io/
    echo "Hello World" > index.html
    ```

    This is just a sample. You can make a beautiful website using HTML, CSS and JS libraries. You can use frameworks such as Bootstrap and Semantic UI too. Make sure you have `index.html` as the main file.

6. Push the code to GitHub, add commit and push.

    ```bash
    git add --all
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git push -u origin master
    ```
    
That's it and you are done! Fire up the browser eand go to https://username.github.io/
